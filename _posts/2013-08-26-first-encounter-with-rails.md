<h2>
	So given that you came from a lot of other programming languages <br/> and frameworks...
</h2>
<p>
	PHP, ASP.net, Java, C#, Perl, VB, Lua, Python, etc..<br/>
	And you want to apprise yourself that RUBY has its own frameworks too.

<h2>RAILS? Can I eat that?</h2>
<br/>

<br/><br/>
<p>I wouldn't say that <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> is the best of the best. But I might say that Rails is in the mainstream apart from other <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> frameworks.</p>
<p><b>First,</b> you might say that it will be hard for you to accept it from soup to nuts because it looks really weird and unpopular unlike PHP and other stuffs.</p>
<!-- <p><pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>&lt;html <b>class="fuelux"</b> lang="en"&gt;</code></pre></p>	 -->

<p>
	<strong>But,</strong> the thing is that... You will surely love its unique structure and marvelous concept.
</p>

<p><b>Second,</b> you don't need to force yourself to learn everything quickly! Of course, it would not be so easy if it's just your first time to use an MVC framework.</p>

<p><b>Third,</b> if you already have an experience in MVC frameworks just like <a href="http://zendframework.com/">ZEND for PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django for Python</a>, <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.net MVC for .net</a>, <a href="http://www.seaside.st/">Seaside for Smalltalk</a>, <a href="http://catalystframework.org/">Catalyst for Perl</a>, <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Wicket for Java</a> and other frameworks... then it would be easy for you to accept RAILS. I'm sure about that.</p>

<p><b>Thousands of companies (from startup to giant) are already using RAILS for their applications.</b></p>

	</ul>
</p>


<p>That is it!  You can now say that <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is a promising Ruby framework.</p>

<h2>What do I need to make it possible?</h2>
<p>References were baked in as well! If you want to start learning RAILS immediately... then you need the following steps (randomly):</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Start lurking around the official site to get an overview about <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">RAILS!</a> This site should be one of your official homes. Of course, you still need a real home. Lol. And we all know that we cannot live virtually forever. RAILS has a nice <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org">blog</a> for recent news and announcements too. You have to be updated too. Also, the RAILS people are generous enough to deliver a good set of guidelines and <i>"Getting Started"</i> articles for the community. Please see the official <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org">Guide book</a> and detailed <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/docs">documentation</a>.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>Read EBOOKS such as <a href="http://beginningrails.com/">Beginning Rails 3</a>, <a href="http://www.manning.com/bigg2/">Rails in Action</a>, <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780987467423.do">Jump Start Rails</a>, and some other books by <a href="http://pragprog.com/categories/ruby_and_rails">Pragmatic Bookshelf</a>. Ebooks are complete and very detailed. So, if you want to gain a lot of information and you are into reading books then this step might be just for you.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>I would also like to recommend the most popular Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl. Go <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">here</a> and be amazed!</li>
		<br/>
		<li>If you are used to learn via Screencasts and/or video tutorials, then <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a> and <a href="https://peepcode.com/">Peepcode</a> would be suitable for you.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>Did you know that you can also learn RAILS interactively? Online courses in a bright and fun way would be so nice to try! Learn a lot of stuffs from <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>. They have an awesome kick named <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> that you would possibly enjoy! Websites that are related with Code School are... <a href="http://www.codelearn.org/">Code Learn</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a> etc..</li>
		<br/>
		<li>Gems are plugins-like that would be helpful for your starter apps. See the official <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> site for more info. Related stuffs: <a href="http://ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby Toolbox</a>, <a href="https://gemnasium.com/">Gemnasium</a>, <a href="https://gemcanary.com/">Gemcanary</a> and more more more.</li>
		<br/>
		<li>If you get stuck and you need some help... Don't hesitate to ask for a hand. You could ask some RAILS related questions in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, and/or straight from the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/community">Rails community</a>. Forum? Visit <a href="http://railsforum.com">Rails Forum</a> for more connections.</li>
		<br>
		<li>
			Bloggers also exist to give us more knowledge about Rails. <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/">Ruby Flow</a> and <a href="http://www.planetrubyonrails.com/">Planet Ruby on Rails</a> are some of the good examples.
		</li>
		<br/>
		<li>Before anything else, please make sure that you already have a working Rails environment in your machine! Read installation instructions from this <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html">post</a> or this <a href="http://installfest.railsbridge.org/installfest/">post</a>. I'll be posting my own version soon!</li>

		<br/>

		<li>Also, <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> is a place where you can see a lot of working sample applications using RAILS. Recent details about various working gems are also posted there. I'll be also posting a post to what Git is all about!</li>

	</ul>

<h2>A sense of patience, fun and hardwork</h2>
<p>It is clear that <i>"Nothing is easy for the first time"</i>. It's not as easy as pie. There's <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/nothing-like-the-1st-time-lyrics-katy-perry.html">nothing like the first time</a>, so you have to be more patient and hardworking. Learning is fun and it never stops. In this <a href="http://railsforum.com/topic/224-hi-im-xiruki/">Rails Forum post</a>, I posted a little bit about my first impression with RAILS. Hope you will learn something from there.</p>
